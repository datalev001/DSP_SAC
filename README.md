# Soft Actor–Critic for Demand-Side Platforms: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Real-Time Ad Bidding
Entropy-regularized Actor–Critic Policies Trained on Logged Auctions to Maximize Profit under Daily Spend Caps
Every time someone opens a website or app, an invisible auction runs in the background to decide which ad to show. These decisions happen in milliseconds and are powered by a system called a Demand-Side Platform (DSP). DSPs allow advertisers to place real-time bids based on user data, budget limits, and performance goals.
DSPs must handle millions of auctions daily, enforce spending caps, and hit ROI goals. Simple rule-based or random methods can't adapt fast enough.
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a smarter approach. Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) excels by handling continuous bid values, driving exploration through entropy, and enforcing budgets via a soft penalty.
This paper shows how to map DSP bidding into an RL problem - defining states, actions, and rewards - and how SAC learns to bid under noisy feedback and shifting user patterns.
We compare SAC to baseline methods, then dive into code snippets, training workflows, and real-world evaluation results.
By the end, you'll have a clear, practical demo of SAC in DSP bidding, whether you're new to RL or seeking business applications.
